### L1 - Dynamic Navigation Bar with Highlighted Sections

### Problem Statement:

Implement a **navigation bar** using the `NavLink` component that dynamically highlights the current section. Your application should have the following pages:

- **Home**
- **About**
- **Contact**
- **Services**

Additionally:

1. Add a **hover effect** that changes the text color to blue.
2. Create a **mobile-friendly navbar**: stack links vertically on small screens (use CSS media queries )
**Challenge**: Ensure the navbar behaves correctly and highlights the active section dynamically even when the browser URL is changed manually.

### Submission Guidelines:

- Submit a Git repository with the responsive navigation bar implementation.
